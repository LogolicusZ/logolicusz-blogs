Lets start with a bit of backstory, some of you will know the name GMK very well, they are one of the most well known keycaps manufactures that are in this hobby. They are known for their Doubleshot ABS keycaps which have a giant amount of color and design choices. GMK till last year, only produced in cherry profile, which was introduced by Cherry in the 1980s. Many have adapted this profile and it still gets used to this day, mostly you will find it on mechanical keyboards like gaming keyboards from Logitech or Razer.

MTNU is a retro inspired profile, while reviewing the first 3D printed prototypes of their new profile it was brought to their attention that [Matt3o](https://matt3o.com/) was working on a similar design. GMK then decided to reach out to him, and work together on this new profile. 

GMK and Matt3o while in the process of trying out a varity of blends (PBT and ABS) with some offering unique advantages and compromises, decided that they would stick with a good PBT material. 

After this the first released sets with the new MTNU profile were classics like Susu (Susuwatari), Beige and WoB (White on Black)

This brings us to Afresh, he is a designer from Poland that has been involved in some projects with this one being his latest set GMK MTNU Rascals!

Afresh wanted to do a set about two characters that are constantly at war in a cartoonish way. When creating the designs of the characters of his set to be a play on his own logo, bein a sheep and a wolf.

While thinking about the color scheme, he decided that while he wanted to do do something simple like WoB but thought it was already kind of overplayed and since he decided on MTNU he thought he could bring another color the the playing field of MTNU. 

He choose to use a dark burgundy, since it still allowed for the clean asthetic of WoB while also having a kind of retro feeling. 

After deciding on the colors of the set he went straight to working on the novelties of the set. These were inspired by old cartoons like Tom and Jerry or the Coyotte and the Roadrunner. This cartoons had often their characters take crazy poses like being electrecuted or having an anvil falling on their head.

After this he worked on creating renders for the set. For this he used Blender which is the most used tool for rendering in the Hobby, to streamline the process of creating the renders he used the Keyboard Render Kit 2 which is a a focused UI layout arranged to present useful tools and content to help any who want to create a keycaps set. This tool was created by [ImperfectLink](https://blendermarket.com/creators/imperfectlink). 

Afresh also had help from his friend [Angelo](can add a socials link) while working on this set. They colaborated before on another set called PBTfans [Poco](https://kbdfans.com/cdn/shop/files/1_2ea782b3-7a5c-4ee0-a172-450448fc9ff7.jpg?v=1682472168).

The IC (Interest Check) fast made short on purpose since Afresh did not know if this was gonna lead him anywhere. Before posting the IC he was already in talks with a US vendor but after getting quotes that the vendor thought were too high they dropped the project, after this it stayed in a sort of limbo for around 3 months.

While having the IC open Afresh was looking for more vendors that would like to run the set. At the moment it is not known which ones yet at the same time he got contacted by GMK themselves, which came as a very welcomed surprise to him.

GMK want that this set is ran and have offered that if Afresh needed anything he should contact them, at the same time GMK told him that they already did the color matching for him. The process of color matching usually takes very long when using custom colors instead of standard GMK colors.

He is expecting to recieve the color samples very soon whilst also expecting to update the IC with the vendors that are gonna run the set and some new renders.

Afresh also would want to add some more additions like:

* Additional child kits to add more colors
* A comic book showing of the story of these two characters shown of in the novelties
* A deskamt 

This set has taken its time to get to this state. The project started around two years ago, starting of as a normal GMK Set. Alfreshs advice for people who would want to run their own set is that, you should be patient, the hobby is in a constant change and sometimes thing dont work out that easily so just breath. You can always pick up your Projects in the future is something happens.

To Afresh from me: Good luck with the updated IC and that you Sir have a smoothly run Sale.
