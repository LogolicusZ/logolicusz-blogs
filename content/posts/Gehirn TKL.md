The Gehirn marked the return of Baionlenja to the customs scene. After getting scammed by his manufacturer on the GB of the Bias R2, many thought he would never return even after explaining his situation to his Discord members many were still doubtfull and believe that he just wanted to make an exit scamm. In recent time we have seen a multitude of exit scamms, that have turned the Hobby upside down, leaving many in a state of disbelief and distrust towards new vendors or even existing vendors. If you want to know more on the current exit scamm situation you might want to see [Taehatypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fdSJgInpsg) video on this matter.
  
As for Baion, Manu one of the most well known Vendor Manager decided to take him under his mantle and guide him to get out of his debt. The Gehirn marks the beginning of Baions retribution, as someone might say. As staited by Manu, his plan is to make new projects that are not run by Baionlenja directly but will be ran trough vendors so that people wouldnt feel like they would be scammed, again.

Now lets talk about the design of the board. Its a classic F12 top mount board, that uses a classic design with refrences to HR Giger and Y2K asthetics.  
The biggest point of interest on the board has to be the weight, showing of a extremly detailed engraving of a fossilised Alien. The board also features more engravings on the top of the board, inside and backside.
   
Also a very prominent feature of the board is Baions own "screw less" design the Baion bolts. On a typical screw less board there would be holes on the top and bottom of the PCB allowing you to screw together, many people dont like this since the screws can easily get lost inside of the case forcing you to open it all up again to get the one screw out. Baionbolts allow you to screw the case together the case on a 45Â° angle, also making it possible to use bigger screws, so that it is harder to loose the screws in the case.

The keyboard hobby has been moving more and more into the direction of instock sales, the Gehirn follows that trend as well. The board would have 2 rounds each with the own colors. So you only had that chance to buy the specific colors you wanted! R1 dropped with a total of 200 units with only WKL (Win Key Less) available, with vendors in 8 different regions, the boards were already produced and the preorder was open for 24h.
  
R2 will drop on the 15 may with a total number of 335 units available. Baion and Manu have also decided to add two more vendors and this time also having WK (Win Key) and HHKB (Happy Hacking Key Board) available besides WKL. The board will also have a two collabs, one being a collab with GMK Symbiote and another one with their own next project GMK Nerve. 
  
I think everyone who joined R1 and will join R2 will enjoy this board. I think it hits a niche that many people will like.
