The Noodle.Zip is a limited-edition keyboard (only 30 units were produced) that was originally raffled in 2023, inspired by K-pop Idol Cho Miyeon from the group (G)I-DLE, who is also known as "noodle.zip" on Instagram. 

The keyboard's design includes various engravings that reference Miyeon, such as her name in Korean and her well-known Instagram profile picture.

The Noodle.Zip is a classic F12, WKL keyboard with a typing angle of 6 degrees and a front height of 18.5mm. It is a two-piece design, featuring an internal brass weight that is visible from the back. 

The keyboard's color is misty lilac, which can appear pale or saturated depending on the lighting.

The raffled version of the Noodle.Zip came with a Mechlovin X DNworks PCB, but any PCB with a JST on the right side will work. The board is top-mounted and can also be O-ring mounted. 

Additionally, the Noodle.Zip's internals are interchangeable with the DNworks Ryujin, allowing you to get different plates made for the board and switch out builds between boards.

## Personal thoughts

I was lucky to be able to pick up a Noodle.zip recently, and I have been loving the board. My current config is with Cherry MX Blacks, and it has been great.

Even though I'm not the biggest fan of K-pop in general, I do really enjoy all of the detail and engravings the board has. The only criticisms I would have are that the plate does not support split right shift and split backspace. However, I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised that it has ISO support.

## Sound test.
